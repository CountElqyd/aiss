Hello,

You might think this is unusual for you to download an executable instead of having it
as Power Point Slides or Presentaion.

The reasons are simple:

1)	You do not need Microsoft Power Point installed to view this presentation.
2)	It should run on most windows based computers fast without waiting for any
	fancy graphics provided by applications like Power Point.
3)	By not having Microsoft office installed means you are not likely a software thief.  
	Unless you bought it legally, most microsoft office installed in most government 
	computers and in homes are cracked version. In simple word means STOLEN.
	


So, if your browser (Chrome,Firefox,etc) and your computer is complaining about how
bad it is downloading executable files, then deal with it. I am 100% percent sure that
the files you are downloading is not a malware.



Regards,

Davey
